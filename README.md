# Fraud Transaction Detection

## Overview
Fraud Transaction Detection is a machine learning-based project designed to identify and prevent fraudulent transactions. This project leverages a trained model to classify transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent, ensuring secure and reliable financial operations.

## Features
- Pre-trained fraud detection model (`fraud_model.pkl`)
- Easy-to-use interface for transaction classification
- Modular code structure for extensibility

## Working Process
1. Data Preprocessing:
The input transaction data is preprocessed using utility functions in utils.py.

2. Model Loading:
The pre-trained model (fraud_model.pkl) is loaded using the model.py script.

3. Prediction:
The application takes transaction data as input and uses the model to predict whether the transaction is fraudulent or legitimate.

4. Output:
The result is displayed to the user, indicating whether the transaction is safe or fraudulent.
